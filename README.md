## About

I made wii.golf in a few days using [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) and Google Sheets. That's right—all player information, events, scores, etc. are all handled with Google Forms and stored in Google Sheets. Yay simplicity!

Went with this approach because all I have to do to approve players is type "yes" next to their name, or make a google form for event registration so I don't have to do that myself. I didn't know Google Sheets could be a decent enough database, but it can for a project like this. Just hoping it doesn't get spammed and broken.
